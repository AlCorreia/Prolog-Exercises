# Prolog-Exercises
Some exercises used at introductory Prolog lectures at Utrecht University. The slides for the lectures where most of the exercises are discussed can be found [here](https://alcorreia.github.io/project/prolog/).

The course focused on knowledge systems, so ``cafeteria.pl`` contains a simple coffee recommendation system.
